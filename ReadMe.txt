This is coding test which was asked me by Tesla. 
Calculate vacation lenght in weeks, for certain year, sunday to sunday, if two month provided, and it maybe leap year.
Presise task in the images. 


They gave only 1 hour, and I passed it with 25%.
I assume, that because I didn't check if input value is right. Or maybe some near end of the year was something off. 
Probably I will never know the right algorithm at the end.

thank you,
